# Prosper202 Release Cycle

We recently implemented a change on how new releases work at Prosper202.

Whenever you download Prosper202 from our site, that will be the latest free version available. Whether you're an existing user or new user, this will be the case. If you are a new user and you just installed Prosper202, you might be confused as to why there is an upgrade message right when you log in and why it is asking you for a Prosper202 Customer API Key. Please read **[Step 0](01-step-0.md)** to better understand what the API key is for and what you need to do to get that activated.

As a matter of policy, we now charge a one time fee of $9.99 for each new version released. If users wish to have the latest and greatest, they can opt-in to pay for an upgrade. You won't be required to pay again unless a new upgrade comes out and you wish to have that version as well. Six months after any version comes out, we eventually make those available free to all users. Upgrades are optional though we always strongly recommend upgrading if you want the most advanced features.

Please keep in mind that $9.99 is only to upgrade to the latest version at that time and that it does not include support. If you require support assistance, we recommend you sign up for one of our support plans.
