If you are not using one of our recommend hosts and are unsure if your host supports the above, please ask your hosting company. Every host should be able to host the requirements above, just maybe not by default.

## Things You Need For The Installation

You need access to your site and its directory and software to proceed with the installation.

These are:

1. An access to your web server (via shell or FTP).
2. A text editor.
3. An FTP Client (if you need to install Prosper202 on a remote server).
4. Your web browser of choice.

Begin your installation by:

1. Checking to ensure that you and your web host has the [minimum requirements](http://prosper.tracking202.com/apps/about/requirements.php) to run Prosper202.
2. Download the latest release of Prosper202.
3. Unzip the downloaded file to a folder on your hard drive.
4. Print this page out if necessary so you have it handy during the installation.

**Note:** *Please install Prosper on its own domain. Although some people have installed it on a subdomain or a subdirectory, this is not recommended and if you are having issues, please install it on its own domain. If you require assistance, please see our note above about subscribing to a support plan.*

You will need to rename 202-config-sample.php to 202-config.php and create a new database and new database user with your web host. Once you do, enter this information in the 202-config.php file in the correct spot and go to your URL to proceed with finishing installing Prosper202.

You should be able to create a new username and password for your Prosper install and login with that.
