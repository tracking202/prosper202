# SubIDs

Almost every network, if not every network, works with something called a SubID. Prosper by default as a system generates SubIDs automatically. So you must be wondering, what is a SubID?

## What Is A SubID

Think of a SubID like a click ID. For every single click that occurs in Prosper, it generates a unique SubID that increases incrementally with every click. So the first click gets assigned a SubID (or click ID) of 1. The second click a SubID of 2. And so forth. This ensures that every click has a unique SubID assigned to it. 

## What Is It For

When a click occurs, a SubID is assigned to that click and passed along. In the event an offer gets a conversion, it knows which SubID converted. Therefore it can pass this information along and tell you the ID of the click that converted and that ID can be traced back to Prosper to the specific click along with pertinent data that a conversion occurred.

## What If I Don't Use SubID

Even if you don't use SubID as a form of tracking (for example, you use pixel tracking), the system still auto generates SubIDs for every click and to avoid it causing issues with your affiliate link, we want to make sure we enter the correct SubID token parameter (specific to each network) and the SubID token ([[subid]]) to avoid any issues.

If you have no idea what I mean by SubID token parameter or SubID token, please refer to setup Step 3 on this site for more info.

## How Do I know Which SubID Token Parameter My Network Uses

Ask your affiliate manager. Unfortunately there are tons of affiliate networks and platforms out there and while we know some of the common token parameters, it is best that you ask your affiliate manager or network for this info.
