# Help and Support

## General Support

Since Prosper202 is free to download and use, we no longer offer free live support. 

If you require assistance, have questions, or need further help in any way, you can subscribe to one of our paid support plans found here:
**http://join.tracking202.com**

By subscribing to our paid support plan, you not only get help from us, but it also helps us cover costs and further development on improving Prosper202 for you. It keeps the bills paid and allows us to continue to give back to the community. As such, we apologize if you require assistance and cannot offer free support.

## Support Plans Info

Our paid support plans include live chat support within Prosper202 during our regular business hours (Pacific Time) Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, breaks, and weekends. They include general support, troubleshooting, setup, and campaign help.

If you reach us outside our normal business hours, we'll see the message when we return and will respond then.

Beyond our plans, we also have one-time fees for various incidental support, such as going in and setting up your Prosper for you or fixing issues on a case-by-case basis. We can also do live screen sharing if necessary. We also offer additional one-on-one time for $175/hour or more that you can inquire about separately for specific situations or needs.

## Specialized Support Plans

If you require special support beyond what is mentioned above, please feel free to contact us and we can figure out how to best meet your needs. You can reach us through the live chat on our site or inside of Prosper.

## Questions

If you have any questions about our support plans, please feel free to reach out. If it's outside of normal business hours, we'll respond as soon as business resumes.
