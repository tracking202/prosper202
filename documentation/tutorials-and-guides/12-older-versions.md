# Older Versions

We recognize that some times users want older versions for one reason or another. We strongly advise against it and as a rule, generally do not allow it. Having said that, we'd like to post a couple versions below because of special needs a handful of users might have that require it but please be aware that we do not offer any other versions besides what is listed here and of the following disclaimer.

## No Support Disclaimer

Please be aware as a rule of thumb, we do not support older versions of Prosper in any way. We always highly recommend you download the latest version rather than use an older version due to it being outdated, having possible bugs or flaws, or any other issues that may have been fixed or addressed in the latest release. 

If you run into any issues, unfortunately even if you are on one of our paid support plans, we may not be able to help. If you have custom needs, you may be required to pay a custom support fee to be supported in these circumstances. As such, you are downloading these at your own discretion.
