# Setup Tutorial

If you're new to Prosper202, setup can be confusing. We've made a series of tutorial videos to guide you through the setup. 

**Please note these video tutorials are a bit dated. For legacy reason we will keep them here for the time being but you should refer to the setup guide under the section "Setting Up Prosper202 Pro" instead. Those are written tutorials rather than video tutorials.**
