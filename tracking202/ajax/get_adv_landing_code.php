			This code is not supposed to be placed on every single page on your website. For example this <u>is not</u> to be placed in a template file that is to be included on everyone of your pages.<br/><br/>
            This code is supposed to be only placed on the first page(s), that an incoming PPC visitor would be sent to.

echo '<p><b>Landing Page: Outbound PHP Redirect Code (FOR EACH OFFER):</b>

		This is the php redirect code, for each individual offer you have placed on your landing page.
		What you would do is if you have 5 offers for instance, you might have when the visitor
		comes into your site, they can click on 5 different offers.  Each offer could be named,
		offer1.php, offer2.php, offer3.php, etc etc etc.  You would have a different page that the
		visitor would click on to goto each offer.<br/><br/>

		For offer1.php, you would want to copy and paste the php code for that specific offer.  So
		for instance if you had 3 ringtone offers on your page like, flycell, playphone and ringaza.
		You would have a link for flycell.php, and on flycell.php you would want the php redirect
		code for flycell.  For your ringaza links, you would have your visitor click on ringaza.php and
		have the php redirect code for ringaza copy and pasted onto ringaza.php.  <br/><br/>

		Basically for each offer has their own php page, and you want to copy the code given below
		for each offer, onto each of their associated pages.  If you have any more questions please
		contact the live support and we can walk you through the process.</p>';
